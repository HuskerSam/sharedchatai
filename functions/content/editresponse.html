        <div class="coming-soon card" style="text-align:left;">
            <p>Did you know that a conversation with an AI like Chatgpt-4 is essentially an array of <a
                    href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api"><strong>text
                        blocks</strong></a>?
                This means that each interaction with AI can be modified just as you would with a text
                document. While this might seem simple, it opens a door to a myriad of possibilities and
                surprising quirks.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To explore this further, we've just rolled out a new feature that allows you to edit responses
                directly in chat like any other document.</p>

        <h3 class="header_recent_document">Why edit responses?</h3>
        <div class="coming-soon card" style="text-align:left;">
            <p> Imagine working on a project that requires accurately explaining your company's brand, product,
                or services. We know that AI, in its current form, can sometimes 'hallucinate', providing output
                that doesn't align perfectly with reality. This new edit feature is a game-changer in such
                scenarios. Rather than going through multiple iterations with the AI or using multiple prompts
                to correct its understanding, you can now directly edit its response. It's an excellent way to
                save time and
                particularly great for when you want to summarize content in preparation for
                another task. </p>

            <p> For instance, in the above example, I asked chatgpt to help me work on a "brand for a new dog
                collar that is super comfortable." Then I used the edit button to fix customer segment add
                that I wanted to target "young customers who frequent social media" as well.</p>

        <h3 class="header_recent_document">How has it been so far?</h3>
        <div class="coming-soon card" style="text-align:left;">
            <p>What about the <strong>quirks</strong>? It appears the AI has an uncanny ability to detect when
                you fabricate
                details it's very familiar with. This quirk has to do with the AI's tendency to correct for
                factual inaccuracies, and the result of very good engineering by the OpenAI Team.</p>

            <div class="text-center">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Take for example, an experiment where I requested default text fonts for web browsers, then
                edited the
                response with some
                humorous, fictional names. Interestingly, when I prompted the AI to continue (which normally
                gets the AI to continue where it left off) it somehow
                knew it had made an error and went back to correct itself.</p>

            <div class="text-center">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded shadow bg-dark-3"

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Typically, "continue" prompts the AI to go on generating where it was cut off, chatpgt instead immediately flagged the error and started over answering my question about basic web fonts. </p>

        <h3 class="header_recent_document">Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="coming-soon card" style="text-align:left;">
            <p>As one of the few applications offering this feature, we're eager to see the unique benefits and
                quirks it may uncover. There's a possibility we might not retain it, but that's all part of the
                discovery process.</p>

            <p>While reflecting on this new feature, we appreciate why OpenAI <strong>might not</strong>
                allow this on their platform - to reduce the risk of misuse or false claims. Other factors, such
                as controlling the data used for training the model, also likely play a part.</p>

            <p>But most of all we are most curious to know your thoughts on this feature. Do share your feedback
                and any interesting
                observations you make while using it!</p>
