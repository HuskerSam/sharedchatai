                <p class="lead mb-4">In the realm of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), managing text lookups for
                    each vector is a critical task, but the approach can vary. Unacog offers three
                    methods for handling text lookups, each tailored to different project scales and
                    requirements.</p>

                <p>A common practice, especially in smaller projects or demonstrations, is to carry the text directly
                    within the metadata. This method is straightforward and illustrates the RAG technique effectively.
                    However, its suitability wanes as projects scale. The primary concern here is cost-effectiveness;
                    for example, Pinecone's vector database limits to 5 million vectors per pod/index, and metadata can
                    quickly consume this space, particularly with large embedding models. This method, while convenient,
                    is best reserved for projects with less stringent space requirements.</p>

                <h2>Using an External Lookup Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Given that databases like Pinecone are designed to handle only metadata and vector sets, not
                    carrying
                    the full text within the metadata necessitates an alternative approach for text lookup. This process
                    involves chunking and upserting data into Pinecone, alongside generating a fetch map, or a JSON
                    file, that maps each ID to its corresponding text and metadata. The separation between vector data
                    and text content is both efficient and cost-effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It circumvents the limitations and expenses associated with storing large text bodies directly in
                    the metadata. This means when a search is performed, the system retrieves text based on its vector
                    similarity to the query, utilizing the database to look up the actual text content. On Unacog, there
                     are two lookup database options: a full database and a document-specific fetch map.

                <h2>2. Full Database</h2>
                <p>This first option generates the entire lookup database. This single file full lookup is easy to import to other systems.
                However the lookup data may often be pretty large, so a good idea is to load smaller chunks on demand in practice.</p>
                <h2>3. Document-specific Fetch Map</h2>
                <p>
                    The second option generates a document-based lookup database. By partitioning the lookup map by
                    document, this method circumvents the need to load an extensive lookup database in its entirety.

                <p class="text-muted">In conclusion, Unacog's Generate Lookup feature offers a range of solutions to the
                    challenges of RAG, from simple metadata embedding to sophisticated, scalable fetch maps. These
                    options cater to a variety of project sizes and complexities, allowing users to effectively and
                    economically optimize their retrieval and generation processes.</p>
