                <p class="lead mb-4">In the realm of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), managing text lookups for
                    each vector is a critical task, but the approach can vary significantly. Unacog offers three
                    distinct methods for handling text lookups, each tailored to different project scales and
                    requirements.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">1. Carrying Text in Metadata</h2>
                <figure class="text-center mb-4">
                    <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/promptplusai.appspot.com/o/images%2Fgenerate%20lookup_metadatatext.png?alt=media&token=9758f130-1edf-4e72-a425-779e8614e17b"

                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">carry text in metadata</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>A common practice, especially in smaller projects or demonstrations, is to carry the text directly
                    within the metadata. This method is straightforward and illustrates the RAG technique effectively.
                    However, its suitability wanes as projects scale. The primary concern here is cost-effectiveness;
                    for example, Pinecone's vector database limits to 5 million vectors per pod/index, and metadata can
                    quickly consume this space, particularly with large embedding models. This method, while convenient,
                    is best reserved for projects with less stringent space requirements.</p>

            <section class="mb-4">
                <h2>2. External Lookup Database</h2>
                <p>Given that databases like Pinecone are designed to handle only metadata and vector sets, not carrying
                    the full text within the metadata necessitates an alternative approach for text lookup. Unacog
                    addresses this challenge by enabling the creation of an external lookup database. This process
                    involves chunking and upserting data into Pinecone, alongside generating a fetch map, or a JSON
                    file, that meticulously maps each ID to its corresponding text and metadata.
                </p>
                <p> This strategic separation between vector data and text content is both efficient and cost-effective.
                    It circumvents the limitations and expenses associated with storing large text bodies directly in
                    the metadata. For users, this means when a search is performed, the system retrieves text based on
                    its vector similarity to the query, utilizing the database to look up the actual text content.</p>
                <p>Implementing an external lookup database offers significant advantages. It allows for a
                    comprehensive and easily accessible lookup system that can be fully exported and integrated into
                    other platforms or systems, granting users greater control over their data pipeline. This level of
                    flexibility is crucial for applications that benefit from pre-loading lookup data or those with
                    specific requirements for data management and serving. By adopting this method, Unacog users can
                    achieve a more scalable, adaptable, and cost-efficient solution for managing text lookups in
                    large-scale RAG projects.</p>

                <h2>3. Document-specific Fetch Map</h2>
                <p>
                    The third option Unacog presents focuses on enhancing performance through a segmented fetch map,
                    which is particularly effective in reducing initialization times. By partitioning the lookup map by
                    document, this method circumvents the need to load an extensive lookup database in its entirety.
                    This approach about optimizing the data retrieval process for efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>In the Unacog webapp, especially for embedded messaging, this technique proves invaluable. It
                    ensures that only the data relevant to a specific prompt is fetched, significantly speeding up the
                    process. This segmented approach stores loaded documents in a cache, streamlining access to
                    frequently used information without the overhead of initializing the entire dataset. This strategy
                    is designed to improve the user experience, offering swift, targeted data retrieval that supports
                    dynamic, context-aware interactions.</p>
