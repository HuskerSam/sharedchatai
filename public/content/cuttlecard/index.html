1. Cuttle is a two-player game using a standard deck of 52 cards.
2. The goal is to be the first player to have 21 or more points worth of point cards on your
field. The first player to reach the goal wins immediately.
3. Each player starts with a hand of cards, and the remaining cards form the draw pile. One
player (traditionally the dealer) is dealt 6 cards and their opponent is dealt 5. The player
with 5 cards goes first.
4. On your turn, you must either draw a card or play a card from your hand. You may not draw
past the 8-card hand limit. If there are no cards left in the deck, you may pass. Three
consecutive passes end the game in a stalemate
5. Playing a point card: point cards are number cards, it is worth rank in points and lasts
until scrapped.
6. Scuttling is the act of scraping an opponent's point card with a bigger one from your
hand. You can only scuttle point cards with higher point cards (1-10). Ties are broken by
the suit: ♣️ (weakest) < ♦️ < ♥️ < ♠️ (strongest). Both are discarded into the scrap pile
after. ace is valued at 1. 10 is the highest point card. Face cards have no point value
- therefore cannot scuttle. 
... 
Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a
scuttle? Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or
Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering. Do Queens protect against
countering with a two? Yes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a
unique effect to one specific card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself)
are protected against Twos (either effect), Nines, and Jacks

                            Even so, the AI still struggled with the rules and could not comprehend certain parts of the

                            Unsure if this is due to the AI or the rule set being too complex for the AI to understand,

points, to scuttle, or as an action card. Explain your thinking as you play.

                            It was important to give it a choice of actions: draw or play a card for points, scuttle or
                            as an action. It was quickly discovered that the AI wanted to hallucinate cards so card
                            dealing had to be done manually.</p>

In that case, I will play the King (K♥️) as an action card to reduce the number of points needed to win. Since I already have 15 points, playing the King will allow me to win the game immediately, as the requirement is now reduced to 5 points.

                            card.
                            This can be confirmed by prompting the AI to see what it knows about the rules of Cuttle
                            which it comes up with the following answer: King is Worth 10 points and has no special
                            abilities.
