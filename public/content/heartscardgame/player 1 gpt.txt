You are player 1, round 2, what card do you play?

Assist:
Since Player 2 led with the 8♦️ and Player 3 played the 3♦️, it's clear that diamonds are being played in this round. As player 1, I need to follow suit and play a diamond if I have one. Looking at my remaining cards, I have the Q♦️ and 4♦️. Since the 8♦️ and 3♦️ were already played, it's safe to assume that the A♦️ and K♦️ are not in play. 

Considering this information, I should play my higher diamond card, which is the Q♦️.

You are player 1, round 3, what card do you play?

Assist:
Since it's now round 3 and I am Player 1, I need to evaluate my options based on the cards played so far. Looking at the cards played in the previous rounds, it seems that diamonds and spades are being played. 

Analyzing my remaining cards, I see that I have the 4♦️, A♣️, 10♣️, 8♣️, 3♣️, 9♥️, 7♥️, 5♥️, K♠️, 8♠️, and 3♠️. 

Since no hearts have been played yet and I want to avoid taking any hearts, playing a heart would be my best choice. Therefore, I will play my lowest heart, the 5♥️, in order to get rid of it.

can you order these cards by suit then value, with A the highest

Sure! Here are the cards ordered by suit (from highest to lowest suit), and within each suit, they are ordered by value (from highest to lowest value):

1. ♦️ Q♦️ 4♦️
2. ♣️ A♣️ 10♣️ 8♣️ 3♣️
3. ♥️ 9♥️ 7♥️ 5♥️
4. ♠️ K♠️ 8♠️ 2♠️ 3♠️

So the final ordering is: 

♦️ Q♦️ 4♦️ A♣️ 10♣️ 8♣️ 3♣️ 9♥️ 7♥️ 5♥️ K♠️ 8♠️ 2♠️ 3♠️
