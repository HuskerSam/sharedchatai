1. Cuttle is a two-player game using a standard deck of 52 cards.
2. The goal is to be the first player to have 21 or more points worth of point cards on your field. The first player to reach the goal wins immediately.
3. Each player starts with a hand of cards, and the remaining cards form the draw pile. One player (traditionally the dealer) is dealt 6 cards and their opponent is dealt 5. The player with 5 cards goes first. 
...

Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?
Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.

Player starts with a hand consisting of 10♦️ 9♣️ 3♠️ 9♥️ 10♠️. As the player with 5 cards, they have the advantage of going first.

Player's first action is to draw a card. They add a +2♦️ to their hand. This move allows the player to increase their options and potentially set up a stronger play in the future.

For my turn, I have two options: I can either draw a card or play a card from my hand. Since I don't have any point cards in my hand yet, it would be beneficial to draw a card and hope to get a point card.

I decide to draw a card. I draw 2♦️ and add it to my hand. 

Now, the field consists of the opponent's 5♣️ and my hand includes 10♦️, 9♣️, 3♠️, 9♥️, 10♠️, and 2♦️.

The point total currently stands at 5 points for the opponent and 0 points for me. It's still early in the game, and my priority should be to acquire point cards to catch up to or surpass the opponent's score.</div>

I decide to play the 9♥️ from my hand onto the field, adding 9 points. I remove the 9♥️ from my hand.

On the opponent's turn, they choose to draw a card.

Now, the field consists of my 10♦️ and 9♥️, while the opponent has their 5♣️.

                    Firstly, Chat-GPT-3.5-Turbo did a poor job of assuming what opponent would do - defaulting to the session's context of the opponent drawing a card. Secondly, it was very bad at strategy recommendations. 
                    Thirdly, unless prompted very specifically, the model wants to only give general tips rather than specific ones based on the game condition. Further optimization may be needed to determine if the model can be used to give specific strategy recommendations given more detail.
