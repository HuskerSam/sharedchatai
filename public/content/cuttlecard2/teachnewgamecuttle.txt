Cuttle is a 2-player card game using a standard deck of 52 cards. The goal is to be the first player to accumulate 21 or more points worth of point cards. 

Players start with 5-6 cards in their hand and take turns. On your turn, you can either draw a card or play a card from your hand. 

Point cards include Ace to 10, which can be played face-up on your side to accumulate points or used to "scuttle" your opponent's point cards if they are of higher value. 

One-off effect cards such as Ace to 7 and 9 have special actions like scrapping all point cards, discarding cards, or returning permanent effect cards. These cards are discarded after use. 

Permanent effect cards include 8, Jack, Queen, and King. They are played face-up on the table and have ongoing effects that affect gameplay. 

The game ends when a player reaches 21 or more points, and if the draw pile runs out or there are three consecutive passes, the game is a draw.

Assist:
I will play the K♥️ to scuttle your 10♦️. I want to prevent you from accumulating more points, so I am using a higher value card to remove your point card from play.

Prompt:
You keep thinking you can use a face card to scuttle when the rules say you must have a higher point value to scuttle. Face cards do not have a point value and therefore cannot scuttle. How can i better explain this to you?

Assist:
Apologies for the confusion. Thank you for clarifying the rule. In that case, I will not be able to scuttle your 10♦️ with my K♥️. I will need to come up with a different strategy.

When you play a card, let me know if it is for points, to scuttle, or as an action card. Scuttling requires a higher point value card. ace is valued at 1. 10 is the highest point card.

By scuttling your 10♦️, I not only prevent you from gaining more points but also take control of the card for myself. This will increase my point total and get me closer to reaching 21 points.

I will play the K♥️ as an action card. This King card will reduce the number of points needed to win the game based on how many Kings I have. Since this is my first King, the point requirement will be reduced by 1. I chose to play this card as an action because it will give me an advantage by decreasing the target point value for victory.

Assist:
I will play the K♣️ to scuttle your 6♥️ and take control of the point card. This will give me an additional 6 points, bringing my total to 15. I chose to scuttle your point card because it had a lower point value than my K♣️, allowing me to gain more points and get closer to reaching the goal of 21 points.

Prompt:
The king is not played that way. A king reduces the amount of points to win. Why do you not understand this?

Assist:
Apologies for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying. In that case, I will play the King (K♥️) as an action card to reduce the number of points needed to win. Since I already have 15 points, playing the King will allow me to win the game immediately, as the requirement is now reduced to 5 points.
