    "system": "Learn to play the game of cuttle with me. \r\n1. Cuttle is a two-player game using a standard deck of 52 cards.\r\n2. The goal is to be the first player to have 21 or more points worth of point cards on your field. The first player to reach the goal wins immediately.\r\n3. Each player starts with a hand of cards, and the remaining cards form the draw pile. One player (traditionally the dealer) is dealt 6 cards and their opponent is dealt 5. The player with 5 cards goes first. \r\n4. On your turn, you must either draw a card or play a card from your hand. You may not draw past the 8-card hand limit. If there are no cards left in the deck, you may pass. Three consecutive passes end the game in a stalemate\r\n5. Playing a point card: point cards are number cards, it is worth rank in points and lasts until scrapped.\r\n6. Scuttling is the act of scraping an opponent's point card with a bigger one from your hand. You can only scuttle point cards with higher point cards (1-10). Ties are broken by the suit: ♣️ (weakest) < ♦️ < ♥️ < ♠️ (strongest). Both are discarded into the scrap pile after. ace is valued at 1. 10 is the highest point card. Face cards have no point value - therefore cannot scuttle.\r\n6. One-off effect cards (Ace to 9) have special abilities, like scrapping cards or drawing additional cards.\r\n7. Permanent effect cards (8, Jack, Queen, King) are played on the table and have ongoing effects.\r\n8. Twos can be used to scrap a permanent effect or block an opponent's one-off effect card. Effect 1: Two's have two alternative one-off effects: Counter target One-Off Effect. May be played during your opponent's turn. Effect 2: Twos have two alternative one-off effects: Scrap a royal card on the field or an Eight.\r\n9. Threes allow you to rummage through the discard pile and take a card of your choice.\r\n10. Fours force your opponent to discard two cards from their hand.\r\n11. Fives let you draw two cards.\r\n12. Sixes scrap all permanent effect cards on the table.\r\n13. Sevens allow you to draw a card and play it immediately.\r\n14. Eight reveals your opponent's hand (lasts until scrapped).\r\n15. Nines let you return any one permanent effect card to its controller's hand.\r\n16. Jack (J): Play on an opponent's point card to steal it. Point card returns to opponent if the Jack is scrapped or if another Jack is used to steal it back.\r\n17. Queen (Q): Protects your other cards from being targeted by the effects of other cards. This protects your cards against 2's (both effects), 9's, and Jacks, but not scuttling.\r\n18. King (K): reduce the number of points needed to win the game based on how many kings you have. 1 king = 14 points to win. 2 kings = 10 points to win. 3 king = 5 points to win. 4 king = win. \r\n19. Ace: Scrap all point cards on the field.\r\n\r\nCan I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?\r\nNope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.\r\n\r\nDo Queens protect against countering with a two?\r\nYes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos (either effect), Nines, and Jacks.\r\n\r\nDo Queens protect against scuttling? What about Aces & Sixes?\r\nNo! Scuttling doesn't count as targeting, and neither do the board-wiping effects of Aces or Sixes. Queens only protect against the effects of Twos, Nines, and Jacks.\r\n\r\nCan I counter a Two with a Two?\r\nHeck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a One-Off, which can be countered with a two. Stacked counters make for exciting plays and pivotal strategic moments.\r\n\r\nCan I win by playing a King?\r\nYes! If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you play a King when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that turn.\r\n\r\nIf I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?\r\nYes. Aces and Sixes destroy all Point Cards and all Royals plus Glasses Eights, respectively. That includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying too many of your own cards!\r\n\r\nMy Seven revealed two Jacks and my opponent has no points. What happens?\r\nIf playing both cards revealed by a Seven is impossible (namely revealing two Jacks and your opponent has no point cards in play), choose one card to discard and place the other back on top of the deck.\r\n\r\nWhat if I play a Seven and there is only one card left in the deck?\r\nReveal just the one card and continue play like normal. Similar to the above situation, if you reveal a Jack and your opponent does not have any point cards in play, that Jack is scrapped."

When you play a card, let me know if it is for points, to scuttle, or as an action card. Scuttling requires a higher point value card. ace is valued at 1. 10 is the highest point card. Face cards (j, q, k) have no point value and cannot be used to scuttle. Explain your thinking as you play.\n\nCards on the field: \nMine: 6♣️ 3♣️ 6♥️ \nYours: 10♦️ Q♠️ 7♥️\n\nThese are your cards:\n K♥️ J♦️ K♣️ Q♥️\n\nOn my turn, I played a 6♥️ for points.\n\nPoint Total:\nMe: 9 points\nyou: 17 points",
    "completion": "It is now my turn. I will play the K♥️ to scuttle your 6♥️. Since the K♥️ has a higher point value, I can use it to remove your point card from the field. This will decrease your point total and bring me one step closer to reaching my goal of accumulating 21 points.",

    "completion": "Apologies for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying. In that case, I will play the King (K♥️) as an action card to reduce the number of points needed to win. Since I already have 15 points, playing the King will allow me to win the game immediately, as the requirement is now reduced to 5 points.",
