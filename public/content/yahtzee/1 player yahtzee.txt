Prompt:
did i qualify for any bonus points?

Assist:
Apologies for the confusion earlier. In Yahtzee, bonus points are awarded if the total score in the upper section (1's to 6's) is 63 or more. Let's calculate your upper section score first:

- 1's: 2 points
- 2's: 2 points
- 3's: 0 points
- 4's: 8 points
- 5's: 5 points
- 6's: 12 points

The total score in the upper section is 29 points, which is less than 63. Therefore, you have not qualified for any bonus points at this time.
