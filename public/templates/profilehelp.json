    "prompt": "LD: can you write help for a profile dialog in my application.  The first tab has 2 main areas, one for display name (users choice, no limits) - it displays anonymous if empty, the second area has a user display image area, images can be uploaded or a random button exists to select a preset.  The second tab on the dialog is where the user defines their preset labels for categorizing documents - the labels are entered in a list area and it's key to hit enter to add new labels when typing.  The third tab shows the token usage from the AI API - daily, monthly and yearly, with breakdowns for prompt, completion and total tokens used",
    "completion": "Sure! Here's some help for creating the profile dialog in your application:\n\n1. For the first tab with display name and user display image, you can create a form with two input fields. One for the display name where the user can type in their chosen name and another for the user display image where they can upload an image or choose from preset ones. If the user doesn't upload an image or select a preset, you can generate a default image or display a placeholder image. Optionally, you can also add a button for removing the user display image in case they change their mind.\n\n2. For the second tab where the user defines preset labels, you can create a list input field where the user can enter their labels. Make sure to add a clear button that removes all labels in case the user wants to start over. Also, add a feature that allows users to press enter to add new labels when typing. You can also add a horizontal scroll feature so that users can view all their labels even if they exceed the width of the screen.\n\n3. For the third tab that shows the token usage from the AI API, you can create a simple table that displays daily, monthly, and yearly token usage with separate columns for prompt, completion, and total tokens used. This will help users keep track of how many tokens they're using and plan accordingly.\n\nOverall, make sure to add clear labels and instructions for each section, as well as help icons or tooltips where necessary. Consider adding an \"About\" or \"FAQ\" section where users can learn more about the different features and how to use them effectively.",
