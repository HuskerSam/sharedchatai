    "completion": "For these native plants, you will want to choose a fertilizer that is specifically formulated for each type of plant. Here are some guidelines for fertilizing these plants:\n\n1. Purple coneflower: Purple coneflowers generally do not require a lot of fertilizer, as they are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. However, you can fertilize them with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring, just as new growth begins. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for application rates.\n\n2. Little bluestem grass: Little bluestem grass is a low-maintenance plant that generally does not require fertilizer. If you want to encourage more growth, you can fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in the spring, just before new growth appears.\n\n3. Wild geranium: Wild geraniums do not require a lot of fertilizer, but you can fertilize them with a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer in the spring just as new growth begins.\n\n4. Swamp milkweed: Avoid using synthetic fertilizers on swamp milkweed, as these can harm the monarch butterfly larvae that feed on the leaves. Instead, use a natural fertilizer like compost or a slow-release, organic fertilizer in the spring, just as new growth begins.\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the fertilizer package and avoid over-fertilizing, as this can harm the plants. A good rule of thumb is to fertilize sparingly and only as needed based on the health and growth of the plants.",

    "prompt": "For wild geranium, how much fertilizer do i give them per square meter?",
    "completion": "When fertilizing wild geraniums (Geranium maculatum), it's best to use a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer in the spring just as new growth begins. When applying fertilizer, it's important not to over-fertilize as this can harm the plant.\n\nAs a general rule, you can apply a thin layer of fertilizer over the soil surface around the plants, avoiding contact with the stems and leaves. For wild geraniums, a good amount of fertilizer would be about 2-3 pounds per 100 square feet. If you have a garden bed that is one square meter, this is equivalent to about 0.22-0.33 pounds of fertilizer.\n\nBe sure to follow the instructions on the fertilizer package carefully and avoid applying too much fertilizer, as this can cause salt buildup in the soil or burn the roots. Always err on the side of caution and remember that less is often better when it comes to plant fertilizers.",

    "prompt": "Purple coneflower?",
    "completion": "Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) is a great plant to add to your garden in Lincoln, NE. Here's how to grow and care for purple coneflower:\n\n1. Choose a sunny location: Purple coneflower thrives in full sun to partial shade. Choose a location that receives at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.\n\n2. Plant in well-draining soil: Purple coneflower prefers well-draining soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. If your soil is heavy, amend it with organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure.\n\n3. Water moderately: Purple coneflower is drought tolerant and does not like wet feet. Water only when the soil is dry to the touch.\n\n4. Fertilize lightly: Purple coneflower does not require a lot of fertilizer. A light application of a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring is sufficient.\n\n5. Deadhead spent blooms: Deadheading encourages more blooms and prolongs the flowering period. Cut the flower stem back to just above a leaf or bud.\n\n6. Divide clumps every few years: Over time, purple coneflower plants form clumps that can become overcrowded and stop blooming. Divide the clumps every few years to keep the plants healthy and blooming.\n\nPurple coneflower is a great addition to a pollinator garden as it attracts bees and butterflies. It's also a low-maintenance plant and a good option for beginner gardeners. Enjoy!",
