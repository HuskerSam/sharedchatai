    "completion": "Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of each feature in the document options dialog that you mentioned:\n\n1.

This note does not get filtered by or affect how the document is viewed by others.\n\n3. Clipboard Button: The clipboard button allows you to easily share the document with someone.
