    "completion": "When creating a document in our system, there are a few key features to keep in mind. \n\nFirst, you can import templates to help you get started quickly. \n\nNext, you'll need to provide a title for your document. \n\nYou can also add labels to help categorize your document. Keep in mind that labels are only visible to the owner of the document. \n\nIf you have any relevant information or notes to include, you can add a reference note. This note can only be seen by the owner of the document and is also editable only by the owner. \n\nLastly, there is an option to set a usage cap. This cap can be viewed by anyone with access to the document, but can only be edited by the owner. \n\nBy keeping these features in mind when creating a document, you can ensure that your document is well-organized and equipped with all the necessary information.",

    "prompt": "the title is optional, if it's not provided the message added to the document becomes the title",
    "completion": "Thank you for the clarification. In this case, it's important to note that the \"Title\" field is optional. If a title is not provided, the message that is added to the document will automatically become the title. It's recommended to provide a title whenever possible to help identify the document and make it easier to search for and identify in the future.",
