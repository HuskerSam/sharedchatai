    <p>The chat request page allows users to communicate with the AI and receive responses for their queries. The tickets provide useful information such as the message owner and time since the message was sent, while the select box and rerun button give users more control over the AI's response. The token visualizer helps users understand how the model operates and provides insight into how text is broken down into its constituent parts. The engine section allows users to choose the appropriate version of the Chat GPT API for the task at hand, with the completion token and temperature fields available for adjusting the output.</p>
