        <li>The objective of templates is to make the document creation process quicker and more efficient by providing
            pre-existing prompts that users can customize to fit their needs</li>
        <li>Templates can be exported as HTML or text to the clipboard for easy sharing via email</li>
        <li>Templates can be filtered by selected flag in the feed to easily select which rows to export</li>
        <li>Templates can be exported as JSON or CSV files to upload and import rows in the create dialog for a new
            document</li>
        <li>Importing templates pre-fills new documents with relevant information</li>
        <li>The clone button in the Document Options modal loads current document tickets as a template in the create
            dialog to create a new document</li>
        <li>Templates (JSON or CSV downloads) can be shared with other users to start new documents</li>
        <li>Text and HTML templates can be shared with other users via chat, email, or by using the browser or phone
            clipboard</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By utilizing these sharing and importing features, users can collaborate on creating efficient and effective
        templates that meet their specific needs. The clone feature and selected flag filter also make it easy to
        quickly create new documents that mirror existing ones.</p>
