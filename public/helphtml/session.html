    <ul>
        <li>Import templates for quick document creation</li>
        <li>Optional title field - if left blank, message will be used as title</li>
        <li>Owner-only labels to categorize the document</li>
        <li>Reference note field for relevant information. Only visible and editable by the owner</li>
        <li>Set usage cap to limit the number of views per shared document. Viewable to anyone with document access, but only editable by the owner.</li>
        <li>After creation, document link can be shared with other users to allow editing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The dashboard displays all the documents you have created or shared, and you can easily filter and find them by assigning labels to each document. Within the document, you can access the Options tab, which allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Add or change labels and reference notes for the document in the Owners tab. You can also use the clipboard button to share the document with others, but please note that there are no permissions, so use caution. The Owners tab also allows you to add reference notes visible only to the owner.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Modify the document details, such as the title or token usage cap, under the Details tab. The archive mode option in the Details tab stops all prompts in the document, preventing you from sending, selecting, rerunning or deleting prompts. By default, the document is not capped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Import prompt templates. You can import prompt templates to quickly add prompts to your document without having to create them from scratch.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The objective of templates is to make the document creation process quicker and more efficient by providing
            pre-existing prompts that users can customize to fit their needs</li>
        <li>Templates can be exported as HTML or text to the clipboard for easy sharing via email</li>
        <li>Templates can be filtered by selected flag in the feed to easily select which rows to export</li>
        <li>Templates can be exported as JSON or CSV files to upload and import rows in the create dialog for a new
            document</li>
        <li>Importing templates pre-fills new documents with relevant information</li>
        <li>The clone button in the Document Options modal loads current document tickets as a template in the create
            dialog to create a new document</li>
        <li>Templates (JSON or CSV downloads) can be shared with other users to start new documents</li>
        <li>Text and HTML templates can be shared with other users via chat, email, or by using the browser or phone
            clipboard</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By utilizing these sharing and importing features, users can collaborate on creating efficient and effective
        templates that meet their specific needs. The clone feature and selected flag filter also make it easy to
        quickly create new documents that mirror existing ones.</p>
