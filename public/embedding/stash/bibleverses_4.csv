Hebrews,hb,57,2,3,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 4,hb_3_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God.
Hebrews,hb,57,2,4,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 5,hb_3_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later;"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,5,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 6,hb_3_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end."
Hebrews,hb,57,2,6,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 7,hb_3_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears,"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,7,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 8,hb_3_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land,"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,8,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 9,hb_3_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years."
Hebrews,hb,57,2,9,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 10,hb_3_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways;"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,10,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 11,hb_3_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest."
Hebrews,hb,57,2,11,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 12,hb_3_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God:"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,12,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 13,hb_3_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin:
Hebrews,hb,57,2,13,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 14,hb_3_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ;"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,14,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 15,hb_3_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry."
Hebrews,hb,57,2,15,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 16,hb_3_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?
Hebrews,hb,57,2,16,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 17,hb_3_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land?"
Hebrews,hb,57,2,17,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 18,hb_3_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders?
Hebrews,hb,57,2,18,Hebrews Chapter 3 Verse 19,hb_3_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief.
Hebrews,hb,57,3,0,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 1,hb_4_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Let us then, though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,1,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 2,hb_4_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,2,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 3,hb_4_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,3,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 4,hb_4_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;"
Hebrews,hb,57,3,4,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 5,hb_4_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,5,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 6,hb_4_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders,"
Hebrews,hb,57,3,6,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 7,hb_4_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart,"
Hebrews,hb,57,3,7,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 8,hb_4_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,8,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 9,hb_4_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God.
Hebrews,hb,57,3,9,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 10,hb_4_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,10,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 11,hb_4_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,11,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 12,hb_4_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,12,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 13,hb_4_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,13,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 14,hb_4_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,14,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 15,hb_4_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin."
Hebrews,hb,57,3,15,Hebrews Chapter 4 Verse 16,hb_4_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,0,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 1,hb_5_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with God, so that he may make offerings for sins."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,1,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 2,hb_5_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way, because he himself is feeble;"
Hebrews,hb,57,4,2,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 3,hb_5_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And being feeble, he has to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,3,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 4,hb_5_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And no man who is not given authority by God, as Aaron was, takes this honour for himself."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,4,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 5,hb_5_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest, but was given it by him who said, You are my Son, this day I have given you being:"
Hebrews,hb,57,4,5,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 6,hb_5_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"As he says in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,6,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 7,hb_5_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Who in the days of his flesh, having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death, had his prayer answered because of his fear of God."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,7,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 8,hb_5_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And though he was a Son, through the pain which he underwent, the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God's orders;"
Hebrews,hb,57,4,8,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 9,hb_5_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And when he had been made complete, he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders;"
Hebrews,hb,57,4,9,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 10,hb_5_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,hb,57,4,10,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 11,hb_5_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear, because you are slow of hearing."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,11,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 12,hb_5_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers, you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God's revelation; you have become like babies who have need of milk, and not of solid food."
Hebrews,hb,57,4,12,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 13,hb_5_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness: he is a child.
Hebrews,hb,57,4,13,Hebrews Chapter 5 Verse 14,hb_5_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But solid food is for men of full growth, even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,0,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 1,hb_6_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, that is, the turning of the heart from dead works, and faith in God,"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,1,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 2,hb_6_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"The teaching of baptisms, and of the putting on of hands, and of the future life of the dead, and of the judging on the last day."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,2,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 3,hb_6_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now we will do this, if God lets us."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,3,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 4,hb_6_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"As for those who at one time saw the light, tasting the good things from heaven, and having their part in the Holy Spirit,"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,4,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 5,hb_6_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"With knowledge of the good word of God, and of the powers of the coming time,"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,5,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 6,hb_6_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And then let themselves be turned away, it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again, openly shaming him."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,6,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 7,hb_6_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God:"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,7,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 8,hb_6_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But if it sends up thorns and evil plants, it is of no use and is ready to be cursed; its only end is to be burned."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,8,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 9,hb_6_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But, my loved ones, though we say this, we are certain that you have better things in you, things which go with salvation;"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,9,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 10,hb_6_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For God is true, and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name, in the help which you gave and still give to the saints."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,10,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 11,hb_6_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end:
Hebrews,hb,57,5,11,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 12,hb_6_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that you may not be slow in heart, but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage, because of their faith and their long waiting."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,12,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 13,hb_6_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For when God made his oath to Abraham, because there was no greater oath, he made it by himself,"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,13,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 14,hb_6_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Saying, Be certain that I will give you my blessing, and make your numbers very great."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,14,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 15,hb_6_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And so, when he had been waiting calmly for a long time, God's word to him was put into effect."
Hebrews,hb,57,5,15,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 16,hb_6_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath.
Hebrews,hb,57,5,16,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 17,hb_6_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that when it was God's desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage, that his purpose was fixed, he made it more certain with an oath;"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,17,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 18,hb_6_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false;"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,18,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 19,hb_6_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil;"
Hebrews,hb,57,5,19,Hebrews Chapter 6 Verse 20,hb_6_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Where Jesus has gone before us, as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,0,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 1,hb_7_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who gave Abraham his blessing, meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death,"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,1,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 2,hb_7_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had, being first named King of righteousness, and then in addition, King of Salem, that is to say, King of peace;"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,2,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 3,hb_7_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Being without father or mother, or family, having no birth or end to his life, being made like the Son of God, is a priest for ever."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,3,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 4,hb_7_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now see how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,4,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 5,hb_7_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And it is true that by the law, those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods; that is to say, they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,5,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 6,hb_7_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But this man, who was not of their family, took the tenth from Abraham, and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,6,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 7,hb_7_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater.
Hebrews,hb,57,6,7,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 8,hb_7_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,8,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 9,hb_7_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And we may say that in Abraham, even Levi, who has a right to take the tenth part, gave it;"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,9,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 10,hb_7_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him.
Hebrews,hb,57,6,10,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 11,hb_7_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi (for the law was given to the people in connection with them), what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,11,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 12,hb_7_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because if the priests are changed, it is necessary to make a change in the law."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,12,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 13,hb_7_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe, of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,13,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 14,hb_7_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,14,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 15,hb_7_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek,"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,15,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 16,hb_7_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"That is to say, not made by a law based on the flesh, but by the power of a life without end:"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,16,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 17,hb_7_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For it has been witnessed of him, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,17,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 18,hb_7_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So the law which went before is put on one side, because it was feeble and without profit."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,18,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 19,hb_7_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"(Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,19,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 20,hb_7_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And as this is not without the taking of an oath
Hebrews,hb,57,6,20,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 21,hb_7_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"(For those were made priests without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord gave his oath, which he will not take back, that you are a priest for ever);"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,21,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 22,hb_7_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus.
Hebrews,hb,57,6,22,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 23,hb_7_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests, because death does not let them go on for ever;"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,23,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 24,hb_7_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But this priest, because his life goes on for ever, is unchanging."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,24,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 25,hb_7_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,25,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 26,hb_7_26,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens:"
Hebrews,hb,57,6,26,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 27,hb_7_27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself."
Hebrews,hb,57,6,27,Hebrews Chapter 7 Verse 28,hb_7_28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"The law makes high priests of men who are feeble; but the word of the oath, which was made after the law, gives that position to a Son, in whom all good is for ever complete."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,0,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 1,hb_8_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven,"
Hebrews,hb,57,7,1,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 2,hb_8_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,2,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 3,hb_8_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,3,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 4,hb_8_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law;"
Hebrews,hb,57,7,4,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 5,hb_8_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,5,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 6,hb_8_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,6,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 7,hb_8_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,7,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 8,hb_8_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;"
Hebrews,hb,57,7,8,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 9,hb_8_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,9,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 10,hb_8_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people:"
Hebrews,hb,57,7,10,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 11,hb_8_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,11,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 12,hb_8_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind."
Hebrews,hb,57,7,12,Hebrews Chapter 8 Verse 13,hb_8_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer."
Hebrews,hb,57,8,0,Hebrews Chapter 9 Verse 1,hb_9_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order."
Hebrews,hb,57,8,1,Hebrews Chapter 9 Verse 2,hb_9_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place."
Hebrews,hb,57,8,2,Hebrews Chapter 9 Verse 3,hb_9_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;
Hebrews,hb,57,8,3,Hebrews Chapter 9 Verse 4,hb_9_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement;"
Hebrews,hb,57,8,4,Hebrews Chapter 9 Verse 5,hb_9_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.
