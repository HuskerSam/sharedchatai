Romans,rm,44,2,15,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 16,rm_3_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Destruction and trouble are in their ways;
Romans,rm,44,2,16,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 17,rm_3_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And of the way of peace they have no knowledge:
Romans,rm,44,2,17,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 18,rm_3_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Romans,rm,44,2,18,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 19,rm_3_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God:"
Romans,rm,44,2,19,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 20,rm_3_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin."
Romans,rm,44,2,20,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 21,rm_3_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets;"

Romans,rm,44,2,22,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 23,rm_3_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God;
Romans,rm,44,2,23,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 24,rm_3_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus:"
Romans,rm,44,2,24,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 25,rm_3_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment;"
Romans,rm,44,2,25,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 26,rm_3_26,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus."
Romans,rm,44,2,26,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 27,rm_3_27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith."
Romans,rm,44,2,27,Romans Chapter 3 Verse 28,rm_3_28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law."

Romans,rm,44,3,0,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 1,rm_4_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"What, then, may we say that Abraham, our father after the flesh, has got?"
Romans,rm,44,3,1,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 2,rm_4_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God."
Romans,rm,44,3,2,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 3,rm_4_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness."

Romans,rm,44,3,4,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 5,rm_4_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness."
Romans,rm,44,3,5,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 6,rm_4_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying,"

Romans,rm,44,3,7,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 8,rm_4_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord.
Romans,rm,44,3,8,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 9,rm_4_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness."
Romans,rm,44,3,9,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 10,rm_4_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it:"
Romans,rm,44,3,10,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 11,rm_4_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account;"

Romans,rm,44,3,12,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 13,rm_4_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For God's word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
Romans,rm,44,3,13,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 14,rm_4_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power;"
Romans,rm,44,3,14,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 15,rm_4_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken.
Romans,rm,44,3,15,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 16,rm_4_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,"
Romans,rm,44,3,16,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 17,rm_4_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"(As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were."

Romans,rm,44,3,18,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 19,rm_4_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children:
Romans,rm,44,3,19,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 20,rm_4_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God,"

Romans,rm,44,3,21,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 22,rm_4_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness.
Romans,rm,44,3,22,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 23,rm_4_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now, it was not because of him only that this was said,"
Romans,rm,44,3,23,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 24,rm_4_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead,"
Romans,rm,44,3,24,Romans Chapter 4 Verse 25,rm_4_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness."
Romans,rm,44,4,0,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 1,rm_5_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;"
Romans,rm,44,4,1,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 2,rm_5_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God."
Romans,rm,44,4,2,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 3,rm_5_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And not only so, but let us have joy in our troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting;"
Romans,rm,44,4,3,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 4,rm_5_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And waiting gives experience; and experience, hope:"
Romans,rm,44,4,4,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 5,rm_5_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And hope does not put to shame; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us.
Romans,rm,44,4,5,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 6,rm_5_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers."
Romans,rm,44,4,6,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 7,rm_5_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life."
Romans,rm,44,4,7,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 8,rm_5_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But God has made clear his love to us, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us."
Romans,rm,44,4,8,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 9,rm_5_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Much more, if we now have righteousness by his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him."
Romans,rm,44,4,9,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 10,rm_5_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For if, when we were haters of God, the death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are his friends, will we have salvation through his life;"
Romans,rm,44,4,10,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 11,rm_5_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God."
Romans,rm,44,4,11,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 12,rm_5_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:"
Romans,rm,44,4,12,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 13,rm_5_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because, till the law came, sin was in existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken."
Romans,rm,44,4,13,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 14,rm_5_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But still death had power from Adam till Moses, even over those who had not done wrong like Adam, who is a picture of him who was to come."
Romans,rm,44,4,14,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 15,rm_5_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men."
Romans,rm,44,4,15,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 16,rm_5_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man's sin was punishment by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number."
Romans,rm,44,4,16,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 17,rm_5_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ."
Romans,rm,44,4,17,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 18,rm_5_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men."
Romans,rm,44,4,18,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 19,rm_5_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man."
Romans,rm,44,4,19,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 20,rm_5_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace:"
Romans,rm,44,4,20,Romans Chapter 5 Verse 21,rm_5_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"That, as sin had power in death, so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,rm,44,5,0,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 1,rm_6_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"What may we say, then? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace?"
Romans,rm,44,5,1,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 2,rm_6_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin, be living in it any longer?"
Romans,rm,44,5,2,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 3,rm_6_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus, had baptism into his death?"
Romans,rm,44,5,3,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 4,rm_6_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death: so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father, we, in the same way, might be living in new life."
Romans,rm,44,5,4,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 5,rm_6_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For, if we have been made like him in his death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life again;"
Romans,rm,44,5,5,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 6,rm_6_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin."
Romans,rm,44,5,6,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 7,rm_6_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Because he who is dead is free from sin.
Romans,rm,44,5,7,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 8,rm_6_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But if we are dead with Christ, we have faith that we will be living with him;"
Romans,rm,44,5,8,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 9,rm_6_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead, he will never again go down to the dead; death has no more power over him."
Romans,rm,44,5,9,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 10,rm_6_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For his death was a death to sin, but his life now is a life which he is living to God."
Romans,rm,44,5,10,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 11,rm_6_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Even so see yourselves as dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."
Romans,rm,44,5,11,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 12,rm_6_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to its desires;"
Romans,rm,44,5,12,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 13,rm_6_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God."
Romans,rm,44,5,13,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 14,rm_6_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For sin may not have rule over you: because you are not under law, but under grace."
Romans,rm,44,5,14,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 15,rm_6_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,What then? are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace? Let it not be so.
Romans,rm,44,5,15,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 16,rm_6_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire? if to sin, the end being death, or if to do the desire of God, the end being righteousness."
Romans,rm,44,5,16,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 17,rm_6_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed;"
Romans,rm,44,5,17,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 18,rm_6_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness.
Romans,rm,44,5,18,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 19,rm_6_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"I am using words in the way of men, because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy."
Romans,rm,44,5,19,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 20,rm_6_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.
Romans,rm,44,5,20,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 21,rm_6_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is death.
Romans,rm,44,5,21,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 22,rm_6_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now, being free from sin, and having been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy, and the end is eternal life."
Romans,rm,44,5,22,Romans Chapter 6 Verse 23,rm_6_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For the reward of sin is death; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,rm,44,6,0,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 1,rm_7_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power over a man as long as he is living?"
Romans,rm,44,6,1,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 2,rm_7_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband."
Romans,rm,44,6,2,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 3,rm_7_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that she is not untrue, even if she takes another man."
Romans,rm,44,6,3,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 4,rm_7_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"In the same way, my brothers, you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might give fruit to God."
Romans,rm,44,6,4,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 5,rm_7_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death."
Romans,rm,44,6,5,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 6,rm_7_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now we are free from the law, having been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter."
Romans,rm,44,6,6,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 7,rm_7_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's."
Romans,rm,44,6,7,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 8,rm_7_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead."
Romans,rm,44,6,8,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 9,rm_7_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death;"
Romans,rm,44,6,9,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 10,rm_7_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death:
Romans,rm,44,6,10,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 11,rm_7_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law."
Romans,rm,44,6,11,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 12,rm_7_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good."
Romans,rm,44,6,12,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 13,rm_7_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil."
Romans,rm,44,6,13,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 14,rm_7_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin."
Romans,rm,44,6,14,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 15,rm_7_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do."

Romans,rm,44,6,16,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 17,rm_7_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me."
Romans,rm,44,6,17,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 18,rm_7_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right."
Romans,rm,44,6,18,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 19,rm_7_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do."
Romans,rm,44,6,19,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 20,rm_7_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me."
Romans,rm,44,6,20,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 21,rm_7_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me."
Romans,rm,44,6,21,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 22,rm_7_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,"

Romans,rm,44,6,23,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 24,rm_7_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death?
Romans,rm,44,6,24,Romans Chapter 7 Verse 25,rm_7_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin."

Galatians,gl,47,1,16,Galatians Chapter 2 Verse 17,gl_2_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way!"

Galatians,gl,47,1,20,Galatians Chapter 2 Verse 21,gl_2_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing."

Galatians,gl,47,2,3,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 4,gl_3_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose? if it is in fact to no purpose.
Galatians,gl,47,2,4,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 5,gl_3_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,gl,47,2,5,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 6,gl_3_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness."
Galatians,gl,47,2,6,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 7,gl_3_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Be certain, then, that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham."
Galatians,gl,47,2,7,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 8,gl_3_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing."
Galatians,gl,47,2,8,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 9,gl_3_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith.
Galatians,gl,47,2,9,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 10,gl_3_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse: because it is said in the Writings, A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law."
Galatians,gl,47,2,10,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 11,gl_3_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God, is clear; because, The upright will be living by faith."
Galatians,gl,47,2,11,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 12,gl_3_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will have life by them."
Galatians,gl,47,2,12,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 13,gl_3_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree:"
Galatians,gl,47,2,13,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 14,gl_3_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give.
Galatians,gl,47,2,14,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 15,gl_3_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Brothers, as men would say, even a man's agreement, when it has been made certain, may not be put on one side, or have additions made to it."
Galatians,gl,47,2,15,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 16,gl_3_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now to Abraham were the undertakings given, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ."
Galatians,gl,47,2,16,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 17,gl_3_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect."
Galatians,gl,47,2,17,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 18,gl_3_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word."
Galatians,gl,47,2,18,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 19,gl_3_19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between."
Galatians,gl,47,2,19,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 20,gl_3_20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Now a go-between is not a go-between of one; but God is one.
Galatians,gl,47,2,20,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 21,gl_3_21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law."
Galatians,gl,47,2,21,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 22,gl_3_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith."
Galatians,gl,47,2,22,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 23,gl_3_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come."
Galatians,gl,47,2,23,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 24,gl_3_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith."
Galatians,gl,47,2,24,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 25,gl_3_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant."
Galatians,gl,47,2,25,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 26,gl_3_26,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,gl,47,2,26,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 27,gl_3_27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ.
Galatians,gl,47,2,27,Galatians Chapter 3 Verse 28,gl_3_28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ."

Galatians,gl,47,3,0,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 1,gl_4_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But I say that as long as the son is a child, he is in no way different from a servant, though he is lord of all;"

Galatians,gl,47,3,2,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 3,gl_4_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world;"
Galatians,gl,47,3,3,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 4,gl_4_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But when the time had come, God sent out his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
Galatians,gl,47,3,4,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 5,gl_4_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"That he might make them free who were under the law, and that we might be given the place of sons."
Galatians,gl,47,3,5,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 6,gl_4_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, saying, Abba, Father."
Galatians,gl,47,3,6,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 7,gl_4_7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours."
Galatians,gl,47,3,7,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 8,gl_4_8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods:"
Galatians,gl,47,3,8,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 9,gl_4_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again?"
Galatians,gl,47,3,9,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 10,gl_4_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"You keep days, and months, and fixed times, and years."
Galatians,gl,47,3,10,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 11,gl_4_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"I am in fear of you, that I may have been working for you to no purpose."
Galatians,gl,47,3,11,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 12,gl_4_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"My desire for you, brothers, is that you may be as I am, because I am as you are. You have done me no wrong;"
Galatians,gl,47,3,12,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 13,gl_4_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time;

Galatians,gl,47,3,14,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 15,gl_4_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,gl,47,3,15,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 16,gl_4_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words?"
Galatians,gl,47,3,16,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 17,gl_4_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them."
Galatians,gl,47,3,17,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 18,gl_4_18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you."

Galatians,gl,47,3,21,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 22,gl_4_22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman."
Galatians,gl,47,3,22,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 23,gl_4_23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God.
Galatians,gl,47,3,23,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 24,gl_4_24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar."
Galatians,gl,47,3,24,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 25,gl_4_25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children."
Galatians,gl,47,3,25,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 26,gl_4_26,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother."
Galatians,gl,47,3,26,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 27,gl_4_27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband."
Galatians,gl,47,3,27,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 28,gl_4_28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God."
Galatians,gl,47,3,28,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 29,gl_4_29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now."
Galatians,gl,47,3,29,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 30,gl_4_30,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman.
Galatians,gl,47,3,30,Galatians Chapter 4 Verse 31,gl_4_31,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman."
Galatians,gl,47,4,0,Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 1,gl_5_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again.
Galatians,gl,47,4,1,Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 2,gl_5_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you."

Galatians,gl,47,4,3,Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 4,gl_5_4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace."
Galatians,gl,47,4,4,Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 5,gl_5_5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
Galatians,gl,47,4,5,Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 6,gl_5_6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love."
