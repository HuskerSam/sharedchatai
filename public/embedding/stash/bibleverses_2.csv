Esther,et,16,3,1,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 2,et_4_2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And he came even before the king's doorway; for no one might come inside the king's door clothed in haircloth.
Esther,et,16,3,2,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 3,et_4_3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"And in every part of the kingdom, wherever the king's word and his order came, there was great sorrow among the Jews, and weeping and crying and going without food; and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth."

Esther,et,16,3,8,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 9,et_4_9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And Hathach came back and gave Esther an account of what Mordecai had said.
Esther,et,16,3,9,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 10,et_4_10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Then Esther sent Hathach to say to Mordecai:
Esther,et,16,3,10,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 11,et_4_11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"It is common knowledge among all the king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death; only those to whom the king's rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives: but I have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days."
Esther,et,16,3,11,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 12,et_4_12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,And they said these words to Mordecai.
Esther,et,16,3,12,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 13,et_4_13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Then Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther: Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews.
Esther,et,16,3,13,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 14,et_4_14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"If at this time you say nothing, then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place, but you and your father's family will come to destruction: and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this?"
Esther,et,16,3,14,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 15,et_4_15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer:
Esther,et,16,3,15,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 16,et_4_16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Go, get together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and go without food for me, taking no food or drink night or day for three days: and I and my women will do the same; and so I will go in to the king, which is against the law: and if death is to be my fate, then let it come."
Esther,et,16,3,16,Esther Chapter 4 Verse 17,et_4_17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had said.
Esther,et,16,4,0,Esther Chapter 5 Verse 1,et_5_1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible,"Now on the third day, Esther put on her queen's robes, and took her place in the inner room of the king's house, facing the king's house: and the king was seated on his high seat in the king's house, facing the doorway of the house."
